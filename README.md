# voidrice

Mykolas' fork of [Kipras](https://github.com/kiprasmel)' [fork](https://github.com/kiprasmel/voidrice) of [Luke Smith](http://lukesmith.xyz)'s [dotfiles](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice).

These are the dotfiles deployed by [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz), as seen on [Luke's YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/lukesmithxyz).

- Very useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings for:
	- vim, nvim, vscode
	- git w/ many comfy aliases & extra utils
	- zsh, incl. fish-like autocompletions
	- tmux (terminal multiplexer)
	- i3wm/i3-gaps (window manager)
	- i3blocks (status bar)
	- sxhkd (general key binder)
	- ranger / lf / vifm (file managers)
	- mpd/ncmpcpp (music)
	- sxiv (image/gif viewer)
	- mpv (video player)
	- calc (python calculator w/ prefilled utils)
	- other stuff like xdg default programs, inputrc and more, etc.
- Additionally for Mac:
	- yabai, with a very similar feel to i3
	- iTerm2, integrated w/ tmux!
	- Alfred, incl. emoji picker keybind
- We try to minimize what's directly in `$HOME` so:
	- Most configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
	- Some environmental variables have been set in `~/.profile` to move configs into `~/.config/`
- Bookmarks in text files used by various scripts (like `~/.local/bin/shortcuts`)
	- File bookmarks in `~/.config/files`
	- Directory bookmarks in `~/.config/directories`

## Install these dotfiles and all dependencies

### Arch Linux

![](./.local/share/archrice.png)

On an Arch Linux (or similar) system, use [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz) ([Kipras' fork](https://github.com/kiprasmel/larbs)) to autoinstall everything:

```sh
curl -LO http://raw.githubusercontent.com/snow-cart/LARBS/master/larbs.sh

# inspect the script, and then

./larbs.sh -r https://github.com/snow-cart/voidrice
```

### MacOS

![](./.local/share/macrice.png)

Some is automated, some is not (yet).
See my recent notes for the steps to take to fully setup:

https://notes.kipras.org/macos.html#xe5IP3iU-

### Other

alternatively, clone the repository directly to your home directory and install [the prerequisite programs](https://github.com/snow-cart/LARBS/blob/master/progs.csv) (or equivalent, e.g. on macos at least GNU `coreutils` are needed).

## Managing these dotfiles

As simple as can be.

Fork the repository and clone it as a bare repo:

```sh
# fork in github

# then, clone into a bare repo:
git clone --bare http://github.com/snow-cart/voidrice ~/.dotfiles

# create an alias to manage the dotfiles
cat >> ~/.zshrc <<'EOF'
alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'
EOF

# ignore all files by default (to start tracking a new file, use git add -f)
printf "*" > ~/.gitignore
```

and now your `$HOME` directory acts as a git repository, just that instead of using the `git` command, you use the `config` one --
this prevents you from accidently committing files in other repositories, and in general has multiple benefits.

originally inspired by "bare repository and alias method" in https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles#Tracking_dotfiles_directly_with_Git

## Integrating upstream improvements

```sh
# see above for the "config" alias
config remote add upstream https://github.com/snow-cart/voidrice
```

and occationally perform

```sh
config fetch --all
config merge upstream/master
```

though, when merging, I recommend reviewing each change, because even if it auto-merged, the results are not always what you want.

e.g. Kipras, and in turn I, merge from Luke, and there are sometimes deleted files, or renamed directories, or just scripts/configs changed
in a way that I don't necessarily like, and so I pick what I want & how I want.

e.g. Luke has moved on from i3 to dwm, meanwhile me and Kipras are staying with i3.

### Performing merges comfortably

because of the bare repository, you couldn't simply use vscode to open the $HOME directory & start resolving changes.
(Kipras [asked](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80946), but it's not available as of yet).

but, turns out there's a work-around: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77215#issuecomment-615834544

```sh
GIT_WORK_TREE="$HOME" GIT_DIR="$HOME/.dotfiles" code "$HOME"
```
